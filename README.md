Epic DashBoard Plugin for Atlassian Jira 5.0+

This plugin creates a new item in the system top menu bar.
It creates some nice listings and graphics to improve the report features when you are using Greenhopper issue scheme.

This first version will group all Epics from a project, listing all the linked user stories and reporting about:

- Total number of story points per Epic.
- Total number of story points burned for each one of these Epics.
